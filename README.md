**AI-based cyber threat detection system**
--

This project is an AI-based cyber threat detection system.
First, the AI learns how a system normally behaves, such as normal CPU usage or network activity.
This normal behavior is referred to as the baseline.

When a new activity comes in, the AI compares it with this baseline.
If the behavior is similar, the system marks it as normal.
If the behavior is very different, the system flags it as suspicious.

Here, I can enter a value that represents system activity.
For a small value, the system shows normal activity with a low risk score.
When I enter a tremendous value, the AI detects abnormal behavior and raises a security warning.

This approach is useful for detecting modern cyber threats like ransomware and zero-day attacks, because it does not depend on known attack patterns.
Instead, it focuses on unusual behavior.

The system also provides a risk score, which helps security teams decide which alerts need attention.
This is a defensive, ethical cybersecurity project focused on monitoring and protection.
